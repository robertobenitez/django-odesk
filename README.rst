Requirements

    * `python-odesk`
    * `simplejson (Only python 2.5 or older)`


Authentication
==============


Quick start
-----------

Before you may use oDesk APIs, you will need to obtain your pair of API keys.
Visit the `oDesk API Center documentation <http://developers.odesk.com/Authentication#authentication>`_
for full details.

Include `django_odesk.auth.urls` to your `urls.py`::

    (r'^odesk_auth/', include('django_odesk.auth.urls')),

Use an URL of `django_odesk.auth.views.callback` as your app's callback URL.
Usually it would be something like this::
    
    http://www.myapp.com/odesk_auth/callback/

You will also need to store your pair of oDesk API keys in `settings.py`::
    
    ODESK_PUBLIC_KEY = '(your public key)'
    ODESK_PRIVATE_KEY = '(your private key)'

Most probably you will want to use model-based authentication (the default),
that works with django's built-in `User` model.
To do so, add the `django_odesk.auth.backends.ModelBackend` to your
`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting::


    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
        'django_odesk.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    )

You will also need to enable both `SessionMiddleware` and 
`AuthenticationMiddleware`::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
        # ...
    )

Using authentication
--------------------

To make the user authenticate with oDesk account, point them to the
`django_odesk.auth.views.authenticate` view, like::

    /odesk_auth/authenticate/

That will send the user to odesk.com site for authentication, and log them in
upon redirecting back. 

.. TODO More on `authenticate` and API token

The user will be asked to log-in at odesk.com, if they are not already, and
to authorize your app, if they use it for the first time.

.. TODO User model creation 

.. TODO Custom user model

By default, the new `User` instance will be created for each unknown user. If 
you want to change this, use the `ODESK_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER` setting::

    ODESK_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER = False

By default, the `is_staff` and `is_superuser` attributes are both set to False 
for a new user. You can change this (and other aspects of user creation) by 
subclassing the `django_odesk.auth.backends.ModelBackend` and overwriting the
`configure_user` method. However, for a simple cases there is a shortcut: use 
the `ODESK_ADMINS` and `ODESK_SUPERUSERS` lists in `settings.py`::

    ODESK_ADMINS = ('johndoe@odesk.com','janedoe@odesk.com')
    ODESK_SUPERUSERS = ('janedoe@odesk.com',)

Those users will get admin or superuser rights, respectively. These settings 
only have effect on user creation. 

To authenticate the user manualy, use `django.contrib.auth.authenticate()`
with a `token` keyword argument.

Limiting access
---------------

Use the same methods for limiting access, as you would with built-in
`authentication <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#limiting-access-to-logged-in-users>`_.

As with Django's built-in authentication, you need to provide a login page
yourself. To make users authenticate with oDesk, you could add line like this
to your `login.html` template::

    Log in with oDesk account <a href="{% url django_odesk.auth.views.authenticate %}?next={{ next }}">here</a>

For simple cases you may just set login page to the 
`django_odesk.auth.views.authenticate`, like this::

    LOGIN_URL = '/odesk_auth/authenticate/'


Authentication without a database
---------------------------------

If for some reason you don't want to use Django's `User` model or the 
database layer at all, you can still use oDesk authentication.
All you need to change is an authentication backend. Use `SimpleBackend`
instead of `ModelBackend`::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'django_odesk.auth.backends.SimpleBackend',
    )

.. note::
    Please note that this type of authentication still relies on 
    `django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`, although
    it does not require `django.contrib.auth` to be added to the
    `INSTALLED_APPS`

When user authenticates, the `request.user` will be a special object with
an interface similar to that of `django.contrib.auth.models.User`
You may use it much in a way you would use Django's `User` object::

    >>> request.user.username
    'solex@odesk.com'
    >>> request.user.first_name
    'Oleksiy'
    >>> request.user.is_authenticated()
    True

Default values for "security-related" attributes are::

    >>> request.user.is_active
    True
    >>> request.user.is_staff
    False
    >>> request.user.is_superuser
    False

The settings `ODESK_ADMINS` and `ODESK_SUPERUSERS` may be used to change those
values for specified users.
The `ODESK_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER` setting obviously has no effect.

.. note::
   Please note that, even though you can check for `is_staff` status, you
   cannot use the database-less authentication to access the built-in admin.
   It relies on the database and the built-in `User` model too heavily.


Clients
=======


There are two convenient subclasses of `odesk.Client` which can save you
some typing.

`django_odesk.core.clients.DefaultClient` is already pre-populated with
oDesk API keys from your `settings.py` file. So you can use it like this::
    
    from django_odesk.core.clients import DefaultClient

    client = DefaultClient() #Not authenticated

    # Or

    client = DefaultClient('your_api_token') #Authenticated
    client.team.get_teamrooms()

`django.core.clients.RequestClient` is a subclass of `DefaultClient`, which
takes a `request` parameter. It uses a token from the session and it should be
used in conjunction with `django_odesk.auth`::

    from django_odesk.core.clients import RequestClient

    def my_view(request):
        client = RequestClient(request) #Already authenticated
        client.team.get_teamrooms()
        # ...

If you plan to use odesk API calls extensively in your views, there is 
another shortcut, the `django_odesk.core.middleware.RequestClientMiddleware`.
It populates `request` with `odesk_client` attribute, which is an instance
of `RequestClient`::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        # ...
        'django_odesk.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
        'django_odesk.core.middleware.RequestClientMiddleware',
    )

Then you may use the client in your views::

    def my_view(request):
        request.odesk_client.team.get_teamrooms()
        # ...
